### Hello from 🇲🇽!

Welcome to this part of the Internet. I'll go with the trend and create this README.md file 😁

I'm a software developer (engineer, artisan, whatever you wanna call it) from Mexico currently and happily employed to work on the Front End side of things. 

I'm also always trying to build or create something to scratch an own itch, and that is also aimed at sharing with others what I've learned in the process. So no fancy libraries or super complex apps in my repos.

You will find more like experiments I make for myself and that I attempt to share in different mediums like [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsvIYWa4X0_DyszTP5nWSyw), [dev.to](https://dev.to/ackzell) posts or [this book-blog-something website](notes-on-vue.netlify.app).

Feel free to reach out on YouTube or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_ackzell).
